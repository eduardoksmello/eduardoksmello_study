## Objective
This project presents a “Hangman” game created with the following coding techniques: 
* functions
* random numbers
* loops
* user input
* string manipulation.

## Overview
When starting the game, the computer selects a random word from a text file (*palavras.txt*). The user's goal is to find out the secret word before "the man gets hung". For each correctly guessed letter, the computer will fill in the blank space where it occurs. On the other hand, parts of the "hangman" will be drawn when the user's guess is wrong.
