## Objective
This project aimed to study the use of clustering algorithms. In the task, the algorithms were trained to group data points from a wine dataset by evaluating their parameters.
## Overview
* Writen in Python
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data pre-processing
* Clustering models train and evaluation
