## Objective
This project aimed to create a game “Guess the Number”.
## Overview
Starting the game, the computer will select a random number from 1 to 20 and the user will try to guess it. 
During gameplay, the computer will respond if each guess is too high or too low. The user will win if he can guess the secret number. 
The number of attempts is delimited when choosing the game difficulty.

In this project, I practiced using random numbers, loops and user input in a short program.
