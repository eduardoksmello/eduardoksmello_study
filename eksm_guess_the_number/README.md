## Objective
This project presents a “Guess the Number” game created with the following coding techniques: 
* random numbers
* loops
* user input

## Overview
When starting the game, the computer selects a random number from 1 to 20 and the user will try to guess it. 
After each user attempt the computer will answer if the guess was too high or too low. The user wins guessing the right number and attempts are delimited by the selected game difficulty.
